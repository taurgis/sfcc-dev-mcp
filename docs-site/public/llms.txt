# SFCC Development MCP Server

> A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with direct access to Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud development tools, documentation, curated agent skills, and real-time debugging capabilities.

This server bridges the gap between AI assistants and SFCC development workflows, offering both documentation-only mode (no credentials required) and full mode (with live SFCC instance access). It provides 38 tools across 8 categories including complete SFCC API documentation, curated agent instruction skills, enhanced SFRA documentation, real-time log and job log analysis, system object exploration, and automated cartridge generation.

Key architectural principles:
- **Capability-gated**: Tools requiring SFCC credentials are only exposed when valid configuration is provided
- **Modular handlers**: Clean separation between tool routing and domain logic  
- **Dependency injection**: Testable architecture with service abstractions
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient caching and range request optimization for log analysis
