# Class PipelineDictionary

## Inheritance Hierarchy

- Object
  - dw.system.PipelineDictionary

## Description

The class provides access to the values in the pipeline dictionary. You use dynamic properties to access values, such as pdict.myvalue or pdict['myvalue']; The class is used in two different contexts, one where access is limited to the declared input/output values and second to a context with full access. Inside scripts, the PipelineDictionary allows you to access declared in/out values (regardless of the alias used in the pipeline and the actual key under which the value is stored). In templates and pipelines, all values can be accessed. In templates the pipeline dictionary is exposed as variable pdict (e.g. ${pdict.Product.ID}). There are several values that are automatically stored in the PipelineDictionary with each request. These include but are not limited to: CurrentSession CurrentRequest CurrentHttpParameterMap CurrentForms CurrentCustomer etc.
